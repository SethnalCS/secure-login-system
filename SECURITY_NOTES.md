# Authentication Security Notes

If attackers gain access to a password database, plaintext passwords expose users immediately

Hashing provides:
- One-way protection
- Resistance to brute-force attacks
- Increased security when combined with salting

bcrypt is intentionally slow to reduce attack feasibility.
